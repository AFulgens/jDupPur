jDupPur
=======

jDupPur is a mini-project for purging duplicate data.

Workflow
--------

1. Generate purgatory file on the given folder
    - I.e. it will generate a file, containing the hashes of all files (recursively) within the given folder
1. Purge the purgatory based on the purgatory file and a primary folder
    - I.e. it will iterate over all files in the primary and delete all files from the purgatory, which are the same

Rationale
---------

### Is this safe?

No, use it at your own risk.

### Is this compatible with X?

Theoritically yes. It's "compatible" with the various `...sum` utilities of *nix and with Total Commander in the sense that the output format is the same as with those tools. This tool, however, support stricly absolute paths, thus if you create a checksum file with some other tool, which contains relative paths, `jDupPur` can't use that.

Another difference is that for `jDupPur` a file not existing is no biggie and will land only on the DEBUG-log, not on WARN/ERROR (as do failing checksums).

### Is this performant?

Performant enough for my purposes.

I did not put too much effort into fine-tuning the code itself (memory consumption, CPU cycles), because based on my experience, the bottleneck is anyways I/O on the disk (even for SSDs), although with stream multi-threading is so easy that I opted for it.

On my SSD (Samsung SSD 850 PRO) this resulted in 100% I/O at around 550MB/s instead of the single-threaded performance of around 200MB/s. See, of course, [caveats for parallel streams](https://gist.github.com/AFulgens/ba1fec3235cfda1269550fb8e9793db3). Here the trade-off is that reading many smaller files on one thread and some bigger files on other threads seem to balance corrently with parallelism. On an HDD this won't work, that's why there is a switch ðŸ˜Ž My numbers on an HDD (Toshiba Performance X300 via USB3) were TODO

On a sustained read (e.g. check of 200GB), on an SSD with parallelism I get â‰ˆ30% reduced runtime against a serials check (e.g. via Total Commander).

### Why Java, maven, and eclipse?

'cause I'm lazy and wanted to do the project as fast as possible, instead of bumping into language- or tooling induced problems. Java is my main language, thus using Java, even if it's not the best hammer for this particular nail.

### Isn't this a bit overengineered?

Probably. I had a little bit of fun here and there.

### Why do you litter `final` for everything possible, why is everything possible with streams/lambdas?

That's an inside joke. Basically just to make extension/debugging as hard as possible.
